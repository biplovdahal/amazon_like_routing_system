Hey! I've written instructions as instructed in the email you sent me!

I've used swagger to list my urls out

/docs (To see the list of URLS)

INSTRUCTIONS:


Clone this project

Install the dependencies: pip3 install -r requirements.txt

sudo psql -U postgres


export DATABASE_NAME=<db>
export DATABASE_USER=<user>
export DATABASE_PASSWORD<user>



Run the development server: python manage.py migrate

Go to /docs to see brief info.

Make sure you create Van objects first aka drivers before creating orders.
